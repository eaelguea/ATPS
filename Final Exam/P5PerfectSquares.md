# Perfect Squares
## Step 1
  - Define the problem
    - Given any positive integer n, find the least amount of perfect squares such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc. that adds up to the integer n.
  - Define solution (recursively)
    - For this problem, I wanted to not only utilize recursion, but find a much easier way
    
## Step 2
