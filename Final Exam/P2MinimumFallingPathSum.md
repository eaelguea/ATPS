# Minimum Falling Path Sum
## Step 1
  - Define the problem: Given a square sized array of integers, find the minimum sum of a falling path through the array. A falling path starts at any one of the first elements in row 1, chooses one, and moves to the next row. However, the next row's choice must be in a column that is different from the previous row's by at most 1.
  - Define solution (recursively):
