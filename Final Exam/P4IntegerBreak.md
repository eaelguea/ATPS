# Integer Break
## Step 1
  - Define the problem
    - Given any positive integer n, break it apart to the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers.
    Then, return the maxed product you can get. Note: assume that n is not less than 2 or greater that 58.
  - Define solution (recursively)
    - For this problem, I wanted to not only utilize recursion, but find a much easier way
