# Partition to K Equal Subsets
## Step 1
  - Define the problem
    - Given an array of integers A, and a positive integer k, determine if its possible to separate A into k subsets with equal sums. 
    Note: these subsets can't be empty.
  - Define solution (recursively)
    - For this problem, I wanted to not only utilize recursion, but find a much easier way
    
## Step 2
